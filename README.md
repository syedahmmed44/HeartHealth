## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SrikarVeluvali/HeartHealth.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Data Folder**  
   Go to the `data` folder in the local repository:
   ```bash
   cd HeartHealth/data
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**  
   Execute the two notebook files in the `data` folder. This will generate two joblib files.

4. **Move Joblib Files**  
   Paste the generated joblib files into the `app` folder.

5. **Create Environment Variables**  
   Create `.env` files in both the `client` and `server` folders. 

6. **Add Environment Variables**  
   Add the following variables in both `.env` files:
   ```plaintext
   GEMINI_API=your_gemini_api_key_here
   MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongodb_url_here
   ```

7. **Update Flask App**  
   In the Flask app, replace the `MONGO_DB_URL` and `GEMINI_API` with the values from your `.env` files.

8. **Run the Application**  
   Open three terminal windows:
   - In the first terminal, run the Flask server:
     ```bash
     flask --app app run
     ```
   - In the second terminal, run the Express server:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```
   - In the third terminal, run the React application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

Now you're good to go! You can now access the Heart Health App.
